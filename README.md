# Mancala

The goal of this project was to make a little game using only the standard DOM API and CSS transitions/animations.
After several years working with frameworks (mainly React), it was a breath of fresh air to go back to the basics.

## Install
Just run the project on a webserver and open index.html

## Development
OK I lied a little, there is a dependency, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>.
I just can't go back to writing magic constants in a giant CSS file anymore.

In the css folder, `main.css` is the one you want to edit. Run `npm run build:css` to build.

## What to do next?
Some ideas :

* Make a <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> version of the UI, to make the game juicier.
* Add sounds effects.
* A multiplayer version on multiple clients with e.g. socket.io.
